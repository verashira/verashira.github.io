I am a second year Ph.D student in Computer Science at Australian National University. My supervision panel includes [Ben Swift]( https://benswift.me/), [Hanna Suominen]( https://cecs.anu.edu.au/people/hanna-suominen) and [Hongdong Li]( http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~hongdong/).

I am interested in language and vision problems as well as broad range of topics related to multi-modality learning. Before coming back to research study, I worked in industry (both casually and in fulltime) as a data scientist for a few years and I have been involved in a variety of challenging problems such as [3D fitting optimization](https://cecs.anu.edu.au/research/research-projects/3d-fitting-optimisation) and [assortment/category optimization](https://www.hivery.com/retail-fundamentals/page#assortment-optimization).
